# Pipe Game

Help! I was trying to make a game in racket, but all of my computer's circuits
got scrambled! I need you to help me unscramble all of the tiles and connect the
circuits back up again so that I can keep on Racketing. Will you accept the
challenge? 

To start a game, open and run the pipegame-view.rkt file and type `(main)`, then select your board size and get started!

To start a new game of the same size, press 'N'.

## Features

## Additional Notes
This game was written after reading [_Realm of Racket_](realmofracket.com) and so there are places where a slightly odd approach was taken because I wanted the chance to experiment with certain features.
