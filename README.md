# Pipe Game

This game was written as a personal project. It is written in Racket after being inspired by Matthias Felleisen's book Realm of Racket.

To run it, open up the cablink.rkt file and enter (main) into the interactions window. 

Currently, the game works on the provided board that I hardcoded into it, future plans involve adapting a maze-generation algorithm I wrote in a class project to randomly generate boards and building in better UI (adding functionality for generating a new board at game-over, creating a score system based on the number of moves, getting better images for each of the cells, etc.) in order to make it into a standalone executable.
