# Pipe Game

Help! I was trying to make a game in racket, but all of my computer's circuits
got scrambled! I need you to help me unscramble all of the tiles and connect the
circuits back up again so that I can keep on Racketing. Will you accept the
challenge? 

To accept your mission, enter ```(main n)``` where ```n``` is the size of the board you
would like to unscramble.

Potential future updates:
 - Move counter / score system
 - Self-contained UI
